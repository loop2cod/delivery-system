echo "  1. Cloudflare can't connect to origin server"
echo "  2. SSL handshake timeout"
echo "  3. Server overloaded/slow response"

echo "  - Check DNS in Cloudflare dashboard"
echo "  - Verify SSL mode is 'Full' not 'Flexible'"
echo "  - Temporarily pause Cloudflare (orange cloud ‚Üí grey cloud)"
echo "  - Check origin server certificate validity"
